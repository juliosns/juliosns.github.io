  "partners-list-description":"Because we are looking for the ultimate in both taste and flavour, we only buy the best beans. And the best beans can be hard to find, because when it comes to the more unusual varieties, they trade at price levels well above normal market rates and are even more expensive than fair Finca, witch is the Spanish word for the plantation where they grown. Each one has its own story and comes with the growing expertise and savoir-faire we are looking for."
